# BOOTH_MULTIPLIER
BELOW I HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS PROJECT AS A COURSEWORK DURING MY BACHELORS FOR THE SUBJECT DIGITAL ELECTRONICS . IT IS A 4 BIT MULTIPLIER TAKING TWO SIGNED 4 BIT NUMBERS AND PRESENTING AN ANSWER . 
THIS MODULE PERFORMS BOOTH'S MULTIPLICATION BY:

    ITERATIVELY EXAMINING PAIRS OF BITS FROM THE MULTIPLIER.
    ADDING OR SUBTRACTING THE MULTIPLICAND OR ITS NEGATION BASED ON THE VALUE OF THESE PAIRS.
    RIGHT-SHIFTING THE INTERMEDIATE PRODUCT TO ALIGN THE NEXT OPERATION.
